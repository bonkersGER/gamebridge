LAN Game Server Rebroadcaster over VLANs

Gamebridge allows you to carve up your LAN party network into many VLANs.  Usually this is a no-no for LAN parties due to the broadcasts needed to find local LAN game servers.  Gamebridge rebroadcasts those game server finding beacons across many VLANs without passing anything else (ARP, BPDU, other non-game server broadcasts, etc.).
